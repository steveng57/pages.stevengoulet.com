## Background

Ok, this is not an exhaustive analysis by any means, but like a lot of folk, I have a news feed/aggregator  that gets things from the left, from the right, and from the centre for my viewing pleasure.  I have a couple of these aggregators actually.  I noticed that some of the posts in it were tilting even a little more to the right than usual, so I decided to look into things.

Now I've already known that the National Post was right leaning, their core news is pretty centrist/right but their editorial bent has become almost Fox like.  There were a couple of post from them that bordering on blaming Alex Pretti and Renee Good's murders on themselves.  And while they have always been _"anti big-government"_, the level of hyper-inflammatory rhetoric coming out lately seems over-the-top.

The other thing I noticed was that the Ottawa Citizen, our major daily here, seemed to be publishing a number of "letters-to-the-editor" style articles under the "You Said It" byline.  Not a scientific survey by any means but they seem to pick right-wing talkers and trolls 4-to-1 over an left leaning letters.  And this is in a fairly liberal city.

So I did a little research on who own's these and other major papers in the country.  I did not like what I found.

## Ownership

The National Post is owned by **Postmedia Network Canada Corp.**.  Postmedia is one of Canada’s largest newspaper chains and controls a huge slice of English-language print media in Canada, including:

---

Major national titles
- National Post (national daily)
- Financial Post (business section of the National Post)

### 📍 British Columbia

- The Province (tabloid daily)

Community / regional publications
- Postmedia also owns various smaller local papers across B.C., though specifics vary over time.

### 📍 Alberta

Daily newspapers
- Calgary Herald
- Edmonton Journal

Tabloid papers
- Calgary Sun

There are many weekly/tabloid publications in smaller Alberta towns.

There’s a large slate of smaller weekly and local titles (e.g., Brockville Recorder and Times, Simcoe Reformer, St. Thomas Times-Journal, etc.).

### 📍 Québec

English-language daily
- The Gazette (Montreal) — the main English daily in Québec

(Postmedia generally does not own French-language papers; Québecor and other companies dominate that market.)

### 📍 Atlantic Canada (Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, PEI)

Since 2024, Postmedia acquired assets from SaltWire Network, which included many regional papers in the Atlantic provinces.

Major dailies
- The Chronicle Herald (Halifax, Nova Scotia)
- Cape Breton Post (Nova Scotia)
- The Telegram (St. John’s, Newfoundland & Labrador)
- Telegraph-Journal (Saint John, New Brunswick)

Other Atlantic titles SaltWire brought dozens of daily and weekly newspapers across Nova Scotia, Newfoundland & Labrador, and Prince Edward Island.  These were rebranded under Postmedia after acquisition.

### 📍 Other Provinces / Territories

Postmedia has historically owned some smaller local outlets in places like:

- Yukon (Whitehorse Star)
- Smaller Ontario and western community papers (e.g., Sault Star)

That's lot of major Canadian cities, maybe they don't like Winnipeg?

## Who owns Postmedia

Postmedia is publicly traded, but effective control sits with U.S. hedge funds, not Canadian families or institutions.

The key players:

### Chatham Asset Management
- The dominant influence behind Postmedia
- Based in New Jersey
- Controls Postmedia primarily through debt ownership, not just shares

### Postmedia Network Canada Corp.
- Trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: PNC.A / PNC.B)
- Has multiple share classes, but voting power is heavily constrained by its debt structure

### Why this ownership is controversial

Critics point to:

- 🇺🇸 Foreign (U.S.) control of Canadian media
- 🧱 High market concentration (reduced competition)
- 🧭 Editorial alignment across multiple papers
- 💰 Cost-cutting pressure driven by debt servicing

Supporters argue:
- Without hedge-fund financing, many papers would’ve folded
- It preserved jobs in the short term

### Is Postmedia Pro-US
The pattern we are seeing:

Heavy reuse of:
- U.S. conservative talking points
- American culture-war language

Frequent sympathetic framing of:
- U.S. Republican positions
- American foreign-policy interests

Less emphasis on:
- Canadian social-democratic traditions
- Distinctly Canadian policy framing

That’s partly ideological, but U.S. conservative content travels well online and drives a lot of clicks.  And the Canadian conservative audiences overlap heavily with U.S. media ecosystems.

### Hedge Fund Influence

Hedge funds do not usually dictate daily editorials

But they do:
- Appoint leadership
- Set cost structures
- Reward audience-maximizing strategies

And in today’s media market: Outrage + culture-war content = clicks + subscriptions

That systematically favors:
- Polarizing commentary
- U.S. political narratives (which already dominate online traffic)
- Conservative audiences who are more likely to pay for newspapers

So the tilt to the right is structural, not conspiratorial.

{% include html-side.html img="Canada-Media-2.avif" caption="Canadian Media Ownership Influence" align="center"%}

But just because it isn't conspiratorial doesn't mean it's not a problem.  The net result is the same, a noticeable shift to the right in our major print media outlets. 

## Conclusions
I am not advocating for media ownership reform or anything.  Though the thought goes thru my head "at least not yet".  It depends how far these right-wing positions are pushed by the owners and editors .  The National Post editorial board seems to have adopted a _"anything a liberal government does is evil"_ position at best, and a _"the American conservative movement is pretty cool"_ stance at worst, bordering on hate speech.  If that continues to impact Canadian print media in such a fashion, I am not sure of the cure.  I've often stated that the US political problems cannot be fixed until they address the "Fox Problem".  

In the meantime, just be aware of where you get your news, and the organizations behind it and their motives.  National Post has gotten so bad that I have removed them entirely from my feeds, as their news contents is not worth the noise coming from their editorial pages.  

If you insist on getting your news from the far end of either side of the spectrum, at least try to understand that's where it's coming from, do some critical thinking on things, and explore alternative sources once in a while.  The _'click-bait'_ media culture we live in today is polarizing and driving wedge issues for its own profit, be aware of that before you go too far down the rabbit hole.
