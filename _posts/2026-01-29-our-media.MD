Ok, this is not an exhaustive analysis by any means, but like a lot of folk, I have a news feed/aggregator  that gets things from the left, from the right, and from the centre for my viewing pleasure.  I have a couple of them actually.  I noticed that some of the posts in it were tilting even a little more to the right than usual, so I decided to look into things.

Now I've already known that the National Post was right leaning, their core news is pretty centrist/right but their editorial bent has become almost Fox like.  There were a couple of post from them that bordering on blaming Alex Pretti and Renee Good's murders on themselves.

The other thing I noticed was that the Ottawa Citizen, our major daily here, seemed to be publishing a number of "letters-to-the-editor" style articles under the "You Said It" byline.  Not a scientific survey by any means but they seem to pick right-wing talkers and trolls 4-to-1 over an left leaning letters.  And this is in a fairly liberal city.

So I did a little research on who own's these and other major papers in the country.  I did not like what I found.

## Ownership

The National Post is owned by Postmedia Network Canada Corp.

Postmedia is one of Canada’s largest newspaper chains and controls a huge slice of English-language print media in Canada, including:

- National Post
- Toronto Sun
- Vancouver Sun
- Calgary Herald
- Edmonton Journal
- Ottawa Citizen
- Montreal Gazette
- dozens of local papers and digital properties

That's lot of major Canadian cities, maybe they don't like Halifax or Winnipeg?

## Who owns Postmedia

Postmedia is publicly traded, but effective control sits with U.S. hedge funds, not Canadian families or institutions.

The key players:

Chatham Asset Management

- The dominant influence behind Postmedia
- Based in New Jersey
- Controls Postmedia primarily through debt ownership, not just shares

Postmedia Network Canada Corp.

- Trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: PNC.A / PNC.B)
- Has multiple share classes, but voting power is heavily constrained by its debt structure

### Why this ownership is controversial

Critics point to:

- 🇺🇸 Foreign (U.S.) control of Canadian media
- 🧱 High market concentration (reduced competition)
- 🧭 Editorial alignment across multiple papers
- 💰 Cost-cutting pressure driven by debt servicing

Supporters argue:
- Without hedge-fund financing, many papers would’ve folded
- It preserved jobs in the short term

### Is Postmedia Pro-US
The pattern we are seeing:

Heavy reuse of:
- U.S. conservative talking points
- American culture-war language

Frequent sympathetic framing of:
- U.S. Republican positions
- American foreign-policy interests

Less emphasis on:
- Canadian social-democratic traditions
- Distinctly Canadian policy framing

That’s partly ideological, but U.S. conservative content travels well online and drives a lot of clicks.  And the Canadian conservative audiences overlap heavily with U.S. media ecosystems.

### Hedge Fund Influence

Hedge funds do not usually dictate daily editorials

But they do:
- Appoint leadership
- Set cost structures
- Reward audience-maximizing strategies

And in today’s media market: Outrage + culture-war content = clicks + subscriptions

That systematically favors:
- Polarizing commentary
- U.S. political narratives (which already dominate online traffic)
- Conservative audiences who are more likely to pay for newspapers

So the tilt to the right is structural, not conspiratorial.

But just because it isn't conspiratorial doesn't mean it's not a problem.  The net result is the same, a noticeable shift to the right in our major print media outlets.
