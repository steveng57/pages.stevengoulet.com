As a result of the trade war declared by the US Federal Government on the people of Canada, many Canadians are changing how they buy things.  I am among them.

It will not be easy, many of the things we buy are from the US, and often they are the only available options.  But like many I am going to do what I can to reduce my dependence on US products.  This page lists some of the resources available to assist in that journey.

## Websites
- [Made In Canada](https://madeinca.ca/){{ site.tb }}.  This is a new site that has really taken off (eh?).  It's a little raw still but a great place to start.  They have recently published a grocery store guide, pretty cool.
- [Canadian Made Products](https://www.canadianmadeproducts.ca/){{ site.tb }}.  These seems to have a souther Ontario focus, but still lots of national brands listed and available.
- [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/ca/featured/madeincanada){{site.tb }}.   Canadian content here.  Yeah, its just Etsy, but every little bit helps.

## Facebook
- [Made in Canada](https://www.facebook.com/groups/256737941555793){{ site.tb }}.  This is a rapidly growing site dedicated to finding ways to spend more of your money at home.  There are the occasional MAGA trolls rolling thru there though, be warned.
- [Meanwhile in Canada](https://www.facebook.com/MeanwhileinCanada1){{ site.tb }}.  This site has been one of my favorites for a while now.  Normally, it is a site that focusses on Canadian culture with warmth and humour.  With the declaration of war on our country, it has since become an advocate site for all things Canadian.



Yes, I fully appreciate the irony of sending you to US based Social Media, but there you have it.
